============

html code for elements for apps to use with bootstrap

To add elements go to home.html in the content page and add a link. Place the actual html and css in corresponding directories based on the element. Add a directory if you deem necesary.

The elements get called in by a javascript/jquery in home.html. Add your call methods in there.
